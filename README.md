**Glad to see you here!**

Life is there for one thing: to uncover itself, like an onion, layer by layer. As an everyday philosopher, curious explorer and independent writer, I am engaged in exploring pertinent areas of life. From food, to exercise, to money, to aspects of thought - whatever there is to learn about, that's where I am and that's what I write about. Always in search of the objective truth.
